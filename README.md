A smart and user-friendly web application that helps job seekers create high-quality, ATS-friendly resumes effortlessly. It offers both HTML/CSS and PDF formats, ensuring flexibility and professional presentation.



# 📌 Introduction

In today's competitive job market, crafting a well-structured resume is crucial but often challenging. Many job seekers struggle with formatting, ATS compatibility, and content optimization. Our Resume Builder Web Application automates this process, enabling users to generate professional resumes with minimal effort.
